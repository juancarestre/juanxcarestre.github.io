# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I'm just a geek (someone who loves technology), I like to write code and sometimes I get obsessed trying to do something really cool. I am interested in all the whole lifecycle of software development, from databases, back-end APIs, unit tests, integration tests, frontend, client-side functional tests and more, all through from a beautiful DevOps pipeline that automates automation, I really like all these things.
