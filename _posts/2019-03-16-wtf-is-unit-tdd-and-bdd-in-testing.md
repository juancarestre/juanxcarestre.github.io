description: I was thinking to publish an article about this, but researching some information I found this written by one of the most popular persons in the mediatic world of software testing (Joe Colantonio), in the future I will write my own article about this in Spanish (with my particular touch of humor), so just go and read Joe Colantionio's Explanation about Unit, BDD and TDD.
